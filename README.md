# 🐙 Neuraloom

**Drag, Drop, Draw—Neural Networks Made Simple**

An interactive iPad app that makes deep learning easy to understand through visual, graph-based experimentation.

Built for **Swift Student Challenge 2026** • 100% offline • SwiftUI + Swift Playgrounds

## ✨ Highlights
- **Visual Node-Based Playground** – Build neural networks by dragging neurons and connecting them freely
- **Real-Time Training Visualization** – See every weight, gradient, and computation as networks learn
- **Story-Driven Learning Mode** – Interactive chapters from perceptrons to backpropagation
- **Complete Transparency** – Graph-based architecture with full forward/backward pass visibility
